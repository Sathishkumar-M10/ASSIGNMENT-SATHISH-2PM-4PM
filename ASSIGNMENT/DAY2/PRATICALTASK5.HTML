    <h2>"Whispers at Dawn"</h2>
    <p>
        The morning sky begins to glow,<br>
        Soft winds hum a tune so low,<br>
        Dreams fade with the rising light,<br>
        As daybreak pushes away the night.
    </p>

    <p>
        In stillness, hope begins to rise,<br>
        Like golden threads across the skies,<br>
        A quiet promise gently drawn—<br>
        New stories wake with every dawn.
